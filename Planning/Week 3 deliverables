Significant issues:
    - Authentication
    - Select 
    - Combining basic React with material UI while not really knowing either of them
    - Integration of everything w/ React, tutorials aren't everything we need

My contributions:
    - I designed and implemented the UI/UX and user flow
    - Redesigned UI/UX with material UI when materialize wasn't providing the functionality
        I wanted.
    - Got initial DB seeds and schemas up and going
    - Designed logos


Remaining efforts:
    - need to wire up detail friend functionality
    - need to integrate test form with add gift container
    - need to re-work add friend container
    - footer bar - figure out inset fab?

Stretch features:
    - finishing
    - oauth
    - CRON
